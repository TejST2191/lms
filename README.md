**. Project Overview:**

- Create a Library Management System where users can:
    - Add books to the library.
    - Borrow and return books.
    - Search for books by different criteria (author, title, genre).
    - Track borrowed books and due dates.

The project will incorporate data structures, generators, decorators, file handling, exception handling, and object-oriented programming.

**2. Features and Functionalities:**

- **Book Management**: Add, remove, and search for books.
- **User Management**: Add and manage users.
- **Borrow/Return System**: Track who has borrowed what books, their due dates, and late returns.
- **File Handling**: Store book and user data persistently using files.
- **Logging and Error Handling**: Handle different errors such as unavailable books, users not found, etc.

**Key Concepts:**

**1. Data Structures:**

- Use different data structures like:
    - **Lists**: To store collections of books and users.
    - **Dictionaries**: To store book information or map users to borrowed books.

**2. Generators:**

- Use generators for iterating over large datasets, like generating overdue books or books by a certain author in an efficient way.

**3. Decorators:**

- Use decorators for functionality like:
    - Logging actions (e.g., when books are borrowed or returned).
    - Adding retry mechanisms for certain operations (like file handling).

**4. File Handling:**

- Store and retrieve data about books and users in files (e.g., CSV or JSON).
- Save user borrow histories and update them as books are returned.

**5. Exception Handling:**

- Handle exceptions such as:
    - User not found.
    - Book not available for borrowing.
    - File not found when loading book data.

**6. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**

- Model the system using classes like:
    - Book: Contains attributes like title, author, genre, and availability status.
    - User: Contains user details like name and borrowed books.
    - Library: Contains a collection of books, user management, and handles borrow/return logic.
